        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
            StrideSneaks began with a single purpose: to make movement effortless and stylish.
            What started as a garage project with two sneakerheads has evolved into a globally recognized footwear brand.
            We believe sneakers should do more than just look good. They should empower your stride.
